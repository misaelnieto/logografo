What is this thing?
-------------------

The logographers (from the Ancient Greek λογογράφος, logographos, a
compound of λόγος, logos, here meaning 'story' or 'prose', and γράφω,
grapho, 'write') were the Greek historiographers and chroniclers before
Herodotus, "the father of history". Herodotus himself called his predecessors
λογοποιοί (logopoioi, from ποιέω, poieo, 'to make').

Ok, what does it do?
--------------------

Right now, nothing. But when fleshed out, Logografo will let you record history
events in a database (grouped by 'bundles') so you can compare events by
visualizing them in a timeline in your browser.
